/* Eloquent JavaScript ch05: Historical Life Expectancy 

When we looked up all the people in our data set that lived more than
90 years, only the latest generation in the data came out. Letâ€™s take
a closer look at that phenomenon.

Compute and output the average age of the people in the ancestry data
set per century. A person is assigned to a century by taking their
year of death, dividing it by 100, and rounding it up, as in
Math.ceil(person.died / 100). */

function average(array) {
  function plus(a, b) { return a + b; }
  return array.reduce(plus) / array.length;
}

function cAverage(century) {
	var ages = [];
	var century = century;
	ancestry.forEach(function(person) {
		var c = Math.ceil(person.died / 100);
		if (c === century) {
			var age = person.died - person.born
			ages.push(age);
		}
	});
	console.log( average(ages) ); 
};

cAverage(19);
